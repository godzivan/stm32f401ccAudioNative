High quality low noise Sigma Delta ADC based on 2 channel timer (TIM1) PWM channels.
Due limited on 44100 Hz 10.5 bits(1904 levels=84MHz/44.1KHz )bits stm32 PWM i make workaround with "sigma-delta floating point encoder" we can have very low noise , high sound quality solution, which better then most onboard sound cards !
